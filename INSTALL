1 Prerequisites
---------------

Boost (>= v1.43)  - http://www.boost.org/
cmake (>= v2.6)   - http://www.cmake.org/
re2c  (>= v0.13)  - http://www.re2c.org/

2 Compilation
-------------

If all prerequisites are satisfied and you are running a *nix like system,
compilation should be as simple as typing: 
  make

If you want to use a boost library that is not installed in a default 
location, than you can specify its location using environtment variables:

BOOST_ROOT       - Installation prefix for searching for Boost.
                   Set this if cmake has problems finding the proper
                   Boost installation.

BOOST_INCLUDEDIR - Similar to BOOST_ROOT but sets the path to the include 
                   directory directly.

BOOST_LIBRARYDIR - Similar to BOOST_ROOT but sets the path to the library
                   directory directly.

To use a Boost installation in /usr/local, you should compile the project 
using:

  BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local make

To compile a release build, use the release target:

  make release

If compilation succeeded, the respective build folder will contain a bin folder
with an executable. For information on how to run aspcud, please refer to the
README file.


3 Installation
--------------

There is no install target. Relevant files to install are:

  build/<type>/bin/cudf2lp
  scripts/aspcud.sh
  scripts/encodings/misc2012.lp
  scripts/encodings/specification.lp

You might want to change pathes to binaries/encodings in the aspcud.sh script.
