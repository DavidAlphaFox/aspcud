1 Prerequisites
---------------

1.1 Build Dependencies
----------------------

Boost (>= v1.43) - http://www.boost.org/
cmake (>= v2.6)  - http://www.cmake.org/
re2c  (>= v0.13) - http://www.re2c.org/

And a C++ compiler like gcc or clang:
- http://gcc.gnu.org/
- http://clang.llvm.org/

1.2 Runtime Dependencies
------------------------

clasp  (>= v2.1.3 and < v3.0) - http://potassco.sourceforge.net/
gringo (>= v4.2.1)            - http://potassco.sourceforge.net/
python (>= v2.7 and < v3.0)   - http://python.org/
bash                          - http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/
coreutils                     - http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/

2 Compilation
-------------

If all prerequisites are satisfied and you are running a *nix like system,
compilation should be as simple as typing: 
  make

If you want to use a boost library that is not installed in a default 
location, than you can specify its location using environtment variables:

BOOST_ROOT       - Installation prefix for searching for Boost.
                   Set this if cmake has problems finding the proper
                   Boost installation.

BOOST_INCLUDEDIR - Similar to BOOST_ROOT but sets the path to the include 
                   directory directly.

BOOST_LIBRARYDIR - Similar to BOOST_ROOT but sets the path to the library
                   directory directly.

To use a Boost installation in /usr/local, you should compile the project 
using:

  BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local make

To compile a release build, use the release target:

  make release

If compilation succeeded, the respective build folder will contain a bin folder
with an executable. For information on how to run aspcud, please refer to the
README file.


3 Installation
--------------

There is no install target. Relevant files to install are:

  build/<type>/bin/cudf2lp
  scripts/aspcud.sh
  scripts/encodings/misc2012.lp
  scripts/encodings/specification.lp

You might want to change pathes to binaries/encodings in the aspcud.sh script.
