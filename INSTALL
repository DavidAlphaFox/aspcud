1 Prerequisites
---------------

Boost (>= v1.43) - http://www.boost.org/
cmake (>= v2.6)  - http://www.cmake.org/

Note that the lexer generatror re2c is only needed for the svn version 

2 Compilation
-------------

If all prerequisites are satisfied and you are running a *nix, compilation
should be as simple as typing:
	make

If you want to use a boost library that is not installed in a default 
location, than you can specify its location using environtment variables:

BOOST_ROOT       - Installation prefix for searching for Boost.
                   Set this if cmake has problems finding the proper
                   Boost installation.

BOOST_INCLUDEDIR - Similar to BOOST_ROOT but sets the path to the include 
                   directory directly.

BOOST_LIBRARYDIR - Similar to BOOST_ROOT but sets the path to the library
                   directory directly.

To use a Boost installation in /usr/local, you should compile the project 
using:
	BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local make

3 Installation
--------------

If compilation succeeded, the respective build folder will contain a bin
folder with an executable.
