.SH DESCRIPTION
.B aspcud
solves package installation/removal/upgrade problems expressed in the
CUDF format. It is intended to be called by package installers, but
may also be used independently.

If the tool is not able to find a solution then it prints "FAIL" to
stdout.

.SH ARGUMENTS

All three command line arguments are mandatory:
.TP

is the pathname of a file containing the problem specification in
CUDF format (both the universe and the request)
.TP
.I output-file
is the pathname of a file into which the solution will be written in
CUDF output format. If the file does not exist it will be created, if
it does already exist it will be overwritten without warning.

desribes the optimization criterion. The criterion is a non-empty and
comma-separated list of signed function names. Each sign is either "+"
or "-", and each function name is one of removed, new, changed,
notuptodate, unmet_recommends. One may also use the macros "trendy" or
"paranoid".
