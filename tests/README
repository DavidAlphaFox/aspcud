The script test.sh runs a few tests. For the script to work a debug build of
the preprocessor has to be available in the build directory and the following
binaries have to be available:
  clasp    - clasp version =2.1.* and >= 2.1.3
  unclasp  - unclasp latest version in svn
  gringo-4 - gingo version >= 4.2.1

Pathes can easily be changed in the script file.
